## Musings
  * ### Volunteer Accountant
    * External Volunteer
      * There is a basis of this

        * External Bookeeper allows continuity
        * Puts more pressure on Central woodcraft

    * Treasurer Training
      * Allows for Consistency within DFs without external involvement
      * Long term solution, maybe not best short term solution
      * Mandating Treasurer training will give Consistency but might not be necessarily
        * The turnover of training means that the Consistency slips with accounts
        * making guidelines for all future Treasurers/Shadows
          * You can't remember everything and we don't know that we haven't been taught stuff

    * ### Web Fairy Weirdness
      * Moving to Central website
        * Would be better for a DF run thing
        * There is a safeguarding issue if the web-fairy/comms decides to reset passwords and access google drives
          * Central Woodcraft website is a mess and worse than ours
        * We need to make sure that Central woodcraft has stuff advertising DFs on central website
        * We should move away from social media being a our main way of communications
          * Websites look better to external visitors and incoming members and their parents
      * WebFairy Team
        * Ex Dfs would be able to do stuff
          * Allows for sharing of skills

    * ### Shift Supply Satchels
      * Make shift kits for on shift people
      * allows for people to be in contact and helps new Coordinator shifts
      * **List:**
        * What their shift is about
        * Note book
        * Walkie Talkies
          * are potentially difficult to use effectivly
          * Not as useful at smaller events
          * Maybe not everyone has a walkie Talkie
            * 3 would be good
          * not a huge expense (Â£22 for 4)
          * anything with batteries needs to be charged
          * allows people to be contactable with no signal
      * Need to consider what we are asking people to bring
      * safeguarding
        * WalkieTalkies could be an issue
          * people can be trained how to use them
            * Safeguarding is especially important
          * WalkieTalkies bring too many other issues and mean more otherness to people on shift and
        * Notebooks
          * people writing lots of confidential stuff in Notebooks is bad
            * Proper training and screening for Mest-Up would help stop these issues from arising
          * Centralised Sign in/out book that isn't carried with them
            * Kind of redundant to have it centralised
