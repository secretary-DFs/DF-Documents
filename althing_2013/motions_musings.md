Motions, Musings and Nominations for Althing 2013
=================================================

Foreword
--------

To clarify to anybody reading this, this document is a draft and a work in progress. The deadline for motion and musing submission is the 1st of September, which is when the preliminary agenda will be published. If you spot something that doesn't make sense, is left out, or otherwise needs correcting, please email <secretary@spanthisworld.com>.

The motions listed are in no particular order, not the order that they will be in in the final agenda.

Motions
-------

### Motion A ###

This Althing mandates that all DF business at Things (including
mini-Things) and Althings will take place between 8am and midnight.

Additionally, no business should take place over a mealtime.

(Zoë Fidler)

### Motion B ###

DFs to give £500 to Venturer Committee to help it become sustainable
(regions are being asked for this amount as well, it won't just be us
giving them their only income).

(Sophie Holden)

### Motion C ###

DFs to give £3000 to Regional council so they can meet three times a
year and plan Things and things better and become more useful again.

(Sophe Holden)

### Motion D ###

That DF regional council and Venturer Committee should share a venue at
least once a year as they can build a better bond between venturers and
DFs and help with the transition to DFs and have better communication
between Vctte and RC.

(Sophie Holden)

### Motion E ###

This Althing mandates that every DF social event should have an area set aside to act as a safe space for women and trans* people.

#### Rationale ####

While Woodcraft is a much more welcoming place than most, safe spaces are still needed and it is important to have a separate safe space (even if it is just a curtained off part of the MEST-UP tent) for those who need it.

(Kitty Howse)

### Motion F ###

[Note, this motion was left on the table from Althing 2012, and as such some of the wording may need to be changed, e.g. "this year" means "the year 2011-2012".]

This Althing recognises that the role of Chair of DF Committee is a large one that cannot be properly completed by a Committee member already holding another role. From this Althing onwards it shall become a primary role, albeit still a one-year role. Those who wish to stand for the role shall be approved by Althing. Any of the people standing who come above RON in an Althing election shall be passed onto Committee. At Althing, in the closed Committee meeting, a new Chair of DF Committee shall be elected from those who were approved by the rest of the Movement. The constitution shall be amended accordingly.

#### Rationale ####

This year I (Louise Delmege) have been unable to fully fulfil all that I wished to as both comms and chair. I have found it impossible to keep the website up to date whilst still facilitating ctte, safeguarding DFs and acting as a laymember for those ctte members that neglect their roles at important times.

DF Camp is an example of this, whereby I was unable to keep the website updated every other day whilst acting as support for the DF Camp coordinating team during the time when the events rep and two of the coordinators were busy. This meant that many essential tasks went undone, this caused many, some severe, problems at the event. Coordinators and Ctte members should report when they will be busy and find laymembers to support them, when this and other responsibilities are ignored, it is up to the Chair to step in.
When Committee members fail in their responsibilities it is the Chair's responsibility to take over their roles. This is not possible while the Chair has another role. Making the Chair of DF Committee a primary role will ensure that, in future, this can be avoided. It will also allow more time for the Chair to check up on Committee members and support them before it gets to the point where vital parts of their role go undone.

The complex election procedure ensures that, since the Chair of DF Committee is a member of DF Committee and carries all the responsibilities of a ctte member, they are approved by the Movement, from the floor of Althing. But, the choice of chair is still made by the upcoming DF Committee after discussion with the current Committee (Changeover being Old/New). Since the Chair of DF Committee is the facilitator of ctte is is vital that it is they who choose them. This will also give the role of Chair the same changeover time as all other roles.

(Louise Delmege, seconded by Ruori MacIntyre)

### Motion G (Democratic Procedures) ###

This DF Althing accepts the document entitled 'DF Democratic Procedures', dated [insert date here], as an official guide to how business should be undertaken at business events (including Althings, Things, and mini-Things). Relevant sections of the constitution will be modified to refer to this document.

(Joe MacMahon)

### Motion H (Dissolution of Regional Council) ###

This DF Althing calls for the dissolution of Regional Council and the creation of a Districts rep on DF Committee in place of the Chair of Regional Council.

#### Rationale ####

The DF Movement works successfully on a UK-wide and a district level. We do not work at the level of regions and nations within the UK. There have been no successful regional/national events in recent years, bar the Welsh valentines Hostel, but, Wales being comprised of 3 districts, this should truly be considered a district level event. A Districts rep would be responsible for encouraging and supporting similar district events and projects.

None of the members of Regional Council have fulfilled their mandated role for the last few years. Some members have worked towards their roles but found it impossible to coordinate DFs at a regional/national level. A single Districts rep could do the mandated work of supporting the creation of new districts more successfully as they would be easier to contact and could collect more experience.

We struggle to fill all the places on Regional Council and have been unable to do so in recent years. There is not enough enthusiasm for this council to work. A single Districts Rep would be more effective. They could do more than is currently done by all Regional Council members.

The existence of Regional Council may actually be preventing others from running events. Being told that it is an elected role to do so can be off putting to people without said role. Also, unused Committee places at Things can currently be used by Regional Council members; this is of little to no benefit to DFs. These places could instead go to valuable volunteers doing short, or long term projects.

RC members have a vote at AG. This vote is rarely, if at all, used by the member, it is most often taken by another DF of that region/nation. There is no reason this cannot continue without having to first track down the often hard to contact RC member and first ask them if they will use the vote.

Regional Council do not help the DF Movement. Dissolving Regional Council will allow us to fund active volunteers to Things. A Districts rep to Committee will increase DFs district level support more cheaply, and effectively. 

(Louise Delmege)

### Motion I (DF Library System Funding) ###

This DF Althing approves the PFA submitted for the DF Library.

#### Rationale ####

The PFA gives money to a member of DF Committee to develop a piece of software to manage the DF Library, and as such it cannot be approved by DF Committee itself. Hence a good option would be to have it approved by Althing.

(Joe MacMahon)

### Motion J (Support for Syria) ###

In light of the current situation in Syria, this DF Althing voices its opposition to British military intervention.  It also instructs the International Opportunities Representative to build ties with organisations similar to ours within Syria so that we can offer what help we are able to.

This Althing also instructs the Treasurer to make a donation from our reserves of £500 to the International Committee of the Red Cross, and £500 to the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.  Financial help is not the only help these organisations require, and as such this DF Althing encourages DFs to volunteer if they feel able.

#### Rationale ####

Woodcraft is an organisation which supports and advocates for peace and co-operation over war and violence.  We voiced our opposition to the war in Iraq in 2003 and we should voice our opposition now.  Intervention in Syria will only make things worse: as we have seen with Iraq and Afghanistan, countries built on western intervention lack stability and extremism flourishes.  Intervention is a short term solution to a problem which needs to be resolved by the Syrian people.  Moreover, many rebel factions within Syria are against intervention for these same reasons.

We should also recognise, however, that in the current political and economic system, we as individuals and collectively as an organisation are powerless to influence the leaders of this country, and should therefore try and mitigate the disaster which is eventually coming.  We should give as much help as we can to those people -- the Syrian people -- who really need it.  Tangentially, we should also be on guard in future for propagandised claims by our own government that there is no money to sustain public services, when we know that money wasted on needless wars and sustaining an imperialist military presence could be spent supporting the people of this country who are in need.

(Joe MacMahon)

### Motion K ###

This Althing instructs that non committee members of DFs who are organising or coordinating national DF projects/events should be expensed to Things on a case by case basis to more formally discuss their plans. 

#### Rationale ####

It would be useful and positive to expense active DFs who are organising and coordinating things/projects/events to attend Things. (I have the early stages of The Share in mind, it would have been useful to have Sam Sender who had a lot of big ideas and plans to be able to attend Things and discuss those ideas formally. Other examples of when this could have been useful for the movement include when I (Imogen Smith) was coordinating the 'Travelling DF centre' for CoCamp or the Welsh Valentines hostel weekend event . I am absolutely sure that there will be plenty more similar examples of DFs organising things off their own back to come in the future.) This morion would allow committee and the DF movement to more effectively discuss what is actually being organised and planned on a national level within the DF movement rather than just what is happening within committee. This motion used alongside the existing Project Fund Application grant would also give active DFs the recognition and support they deserve to run and coordinate exciting national projects and events. It would also promote participation in national DFs and empower DFs to make their ideas happen regardless of whether or not they hold a committee role. Things would be made more relevant, effective and inclusive.

(Imogen Smith)

### Motion L ###

This Althing appreciates the value of the work done by volunteers who are not elected or are elected to non-ctte roles and encourages DF Committee to invite volunteers to be expensed to Things in cases where that would be of significant benefit to their work.

(Saskia Neibig)

### Motion M ###

This Althing dissolves the role of Fundraising Rep and proposes a training session on fundraising take place at Old/New so that all ctte reps are familiar with the basics.

#### Rationale ####

The nature of fundraising is currently such that the person
writing an application needs to have an intimate knowledge of what the
money is intended for. People in the role of Affiliations, Campaigns,
Training, Projects and subsidiary positions thereof are better placed to
source and find funding related to their field, as well as being more
able to explain the need for the money and the value of the investment.
The likelihood of successfully engaging someone in such a lengthy and
heavily administrative task is also increased when they are directly
involved in the outcome.

(Saskia Neibig)

Musings
-------

### Musing Alpha ###

DF events could be bore inclusive to those who do not drink or those who feel alienated by drinking. Drinking can be an enjoyable social activity, but it can also be quite exclusive. It can exclude those who are those under the age of 18, those who cannot drink for medical reasons, those who wish to bring their young children to an event, and those who choose not to drink for cultural, religious or personal reasons, among others. Suggestions for discussion: alcohol free events, alcohol free nights on longer events, specific drinking/dry zones, or no alcohol over a certain percentage allowed at events (these are just examples of ideas and not proposals). I just don’t want us to end up like the kinsfolk who have said that they wouldn't come to AG if it were an alcohol free event. A moot point – if an event cannot be enjoyed without alcohol, then could that be an indicator that there is something wrong with the event? 

(Anonymous)

### Musing Beta ###

If there are DFs with children who would like to come to an event, other DFs could provide a crèche/babysitting service to allow parents more engagement with the event. This could be arranged on a shift or rota basis.

(Anonymous)

### Musing Gamma ###

At events where there are DJs, a DF with a spotify subscription might be a cheaper option.

(Anonymous)

### Musing Delta ###

Including people who want to remain sober.

(Gabriel Hawkins-Pottier)

### Musing Epsilon ###

Including DFs with children

(Gabriel Hawkins-Pottier)

### Musing Zeta ###

Fairer fare reform

(Gabriel Hawkins-Pottier)

### Musing Eta ###

1. Over the past 5 years TREE has encouraged and promoted youth participation across Woodcraft by providing: training; mentoring; resources; case studies and stories; improving communication online, between districts and between age groups, as well as championing youth participation in WcF democracy at all levels. What's more, young people have been involved in all of this from outset to outcome! The project ends in April 2014, but after so much work, the success should not stop there. A new volunteer role has been proposed to continue this work and keep youth participation levels high: the Youth Participation Ambassador. Two TREE members of staff ran a workshop at DF Camp about what the role should involve and what support should be available. They have written up a job role and person specification for prospective Ambassadors and will be running a training weekend 4-6th October.

2. Job role / Person spec

3. As a Movement which prides ourselves on our democratic nature, and encourages members (and non-members) to get involved at all levels with issues which affect them, DFs should do all we can to support both the scheme as a whole, and individual ambassadors.
There are three main areas for discussion:
    1. Is the job description/person spec suitable?
        1. Is it clear?
        2. Is it accessible?
        3. Is it flexible enough to be used across Woodcraft, by volunteers of any age, gender, nationality etc.
    2. How can DFs support the whole scheme?
        1. Training?
        2. Promotion?
        3. Consultancy?
    3. How can DFs support individual Ambassadors?
        1. Mentoring?
        2. Case studies?
        3. Span That World posts?
        4. Be active on “Young Leaders” Facebook page – asking / answering questions
4. Not every YPA will have the time, ability or resources to continue all the activities TREE has been carrying out. Can Althing help to prioritise the activities in the list attached and discuss how DFs could support Ambassadors who choose to carry them out.

(Josh Hope-Collins)

### Musing Theta ###

Drinking is an important part of British culture. How do we make sure we are including people who like a good drink to continue coming to our events?

(Joe Bowler)

### Musing Iota ###

There has been a lot of discussion about the accessibility of DFs (within wider WCF) recently. Personally I think that we're a reasonable bunch and can and will be very accomodating to any who have different needs. I think a lot of the talk about inacessibility comes from a lack of knowledge about the DF movement. Maybe we could start sending out fliers for DF events to venturer groups and districts nationall in an effort to get more venturers to make the transition to national DF events?
Many DFs do not have district DF groups but are involved in local groups in other ways (leading etc) so we could maybe send things out to districts as a whole?
Thoughts?

(Toby Attrill)

### Musing Kappa ###

In order to grow Woodcraft Folk and the DF movement's work,
how do make the most of non-traditional platforms for education?
