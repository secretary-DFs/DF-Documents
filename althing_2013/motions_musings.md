Motions, Musings and Nominations for Althing 2013
=================================================

Motions
-------

### Motion A ###

This Althing mandates that all DF business at Things (including
mini-Things) and Althings will take place between 8am and midnight.

Additionally, no business should take place over a mealtime.

(Zoë Fidler)

### Motion B ###

DFs to give £500 to Venturer Committee to help it become sustainable
(regions are being asked for this amount as well, it won't just be us
giving them their only income).

(Sophie Holden)

### Motion C ###

DFs to give £3000 to Regional council so they can meet three times a
year and plan Things and things better and become more useful again.

(Sophe Holden)

### Motion D ###

That DF regional council and Venturer Committee should share a venue at
least once a year as they can build a better bond between venturers and
DFs and help with the transition to DFs and have better communication
between Vctte and RC.

(Sophie Holden)

### Motion E ###

Safe spaces on camps for women & trans* folk

(Kitty Howse)

### Motion F ###

(Chair role motion tabled from last year)

Musings
-------

### Musing Alpha ###

DF events could be bore inclusive to those who do not drink or those who feel alienated by drinking. Drinking can be an enjoyable social activity, but it can also be quite exclusive. It can exclude those who are those under the age of 18, those who cannot drink for medical reasons, those who wish to bring their young children to an event, and those who choose not to drink for cultural, religious or personal reasons, among others. Suggestions for discussion: alcohol free events, alcohol free nights on longer events, specific drinking/dry zones, or no alcohol over a certain percentage allowed at events (these are just examples of ideas and not proposals). I just don’t want us to end up like the kinsfolk who have said that they wouldn't come to AG if it were an alcohol free event. A moot point – if an event cannot be enjoyed without alcohol, then could that be an indicator that there is something wrong with the event?

### Musing Beta ###

If there are DFs with children who would like to come to an event, other DFs could provide a crèche/babysitting service to allow parents more engagement with the event. This could be arranged on a shift or rota basis.

(Anonymous)

### Musing Gamma ###

At events where there are DJs, a DF with a spotify subscription might be a cheaper option.

(Anonymous)

### Musing Delta ###

Including people who want to remain sober.

(Gabriel Hawkins-Pottier)

### Musing Epsilon ###

Including DFs with children

(Gabriel Hawkins-Pottier)

### Musing Zeta ###

Fairer fare reform

(Gabriel Hawkins-Pottier)
