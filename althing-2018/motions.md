Motions, Musings and Nominations for Althing 2013
=================================================

Foreword
--------

The motions listed here are now in the order they will be in on the final agenda.  The deadline for submission has passed, and as such if any new motions or musings are received they will be discussed only if there is sufficient time available.  Nominations for elections may still be received.

Motions
-------

### Motion 1 (Love Island) ###

This Althing notes that Love Island is one of TV and pop culture's greatest current phenomena.
This Althing also notes the barriers to general cultural awareness of the DF Movement.
Therefore, this Althing instructs the secretary to ensure the selection of two DFs to apply to the next series of Love Island.

#### Rationale ####

The people selected to be applicants will be able to get the movement more mainstream recognition, and slightly further radicalise the TV show 'Love Island,' if they manage to get onto the show.
