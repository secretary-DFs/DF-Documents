Motions, Musings and Nominations for Althing 2018
=================================================

Foreword
--------

The motions listed here are now in the order they will be in on the final agenda.  The deadline for submission has passed, and as such if any new motions or musings are received they will be discussed only if there is sufficient time available.  Nominations for elections may still be received.

(This section will be included when released after 16th August, it is not true yet)

Motions
-------

### Motion 1 (Love Island) ###

This Althing notes that Love Island is one of TV and pop culture's greatest current phenomena.
This Althing also notes the barriers to general cultural awareness of the DF Movement.
Therefore, this Althing instructs the secretary to ensure the selection of two DFs to apply to the next series of Love Island.

#### Rationale ####

The people selected to be applicants will be able to get the movement more mainstream recognition, and slightly further radicalise the TV show 'Love Island,' if they manage to get onto the show.

### Motion 2 (Vote of No Confidence Reasonings) ###

This Althing creates a requirement that the proposer of a Vote of No Confidence, in either Committee or Non-Committee roles, must submit a formal statement of reasoning, to be sent to the person being voted on and DF Committee, alongside their call for the vote.

The Constitution shall be amended as follows:

	Append section B.1.5.2.1 of the constitution with:

	"Whoever submits the call for a vote of no confidence in a committee role must provide a written statement of reasoning for this decision. This statement will be sent to the committee role in question when they are informed that someone has requested a vote of no confidence in them, and the other members of committee when they are informed about the call."

	Appends section B.3.5.2.1 of the constitution with:

	"Whoever submits the call for a vote of no confidence must provide a written statement of reasoning for this decision. This statement will be sent to the role in question when they are informed that someone has requested a vote of no confidence in them, and DF Committee when they are informed about the call."

#### Rationale ####

When someone has a Vote of No Confidence called in them, it will often be called by someone who wishes to remain anonymous. This gives the person subject to the vote very little chance to build a case in their favour, as they don't know who, and from what capacity, sent it, and they also don't know why it has been called. This means that they have very little to work on to convince DF Committee that the issues that have been seen in them can be resolved.
