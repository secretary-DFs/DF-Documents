\maketitle

\section{Foreword}
Where the procedures specified in this document conflict with the DF Constitution, then the procedures in the Constitution shall prevail.  That is to say, this document may not override the Constitution.

\section{Business}
In all transactions of DF business (for example, at Althing, a Thing, or a mini-Thing), a system of consensus-based decision making should be used.  Participants are strongly encouraged to read ``The A-Z of Good Discussion'', which gives a good outline of the consensus system.

Additionally, at the beginning of business, the chair will briefly explain the principles and practicalities of this system, in particular the hand signals being used.  The chair may of course also deliver this explanation at later points in the discussion if, for example, new people have joined in or on return from a break.

\section{Consensus}
In this section, some recommendations will be made regarding consensus-based decision making.  It is important, however, to note that this document recognises that this is a living system and therefore subject to change.  As such, it should be recognised that these are only recommendations, and if a particular business event feels the need to adapt or modify them then it should feel free to do so.

\subsection{Chairing and speaking}
To participate in a discussion, you should indicate (to the chair) that you want to make a point, usually by raising your hand.  The chair will then call on you at a suitable time, when you should make your point in a clear and accessible manner.  You should make sure to listen to other people's points as well as making your own, and if your point has already been covered by another person, don't say it again.

Chairing should involve maintaining a list of people who wish to speak, firstly so that you can keep track of what order people raised their hands in, and secondly so that they don't have to keep their hands in the air until it is their turn to speak.  It is also good for the chair to periodically sum up the discussion and provide insight into proposals.  (Note that this does not mean adding more points or ideas to the discussion, merely summarising what has already been said.)

Business should begin naturally with one person chairing and introducing the topics for discussion, and they may choose to continue chairing the discussion throughout.  However it is important that the participants feel able to challenge the authority of the chair for a good reason (for example if the chair is biased or abusing their authority), and if they choose, appoint a new chair.  It is also good practice for different people to chair the discussion at different points so that more people can gain experience of chairing discussions.

\subsection{Important distinctions: Proposals, Points, and Direct Points}
\subsubsection{Proposals}
If you have a good idea of something to do, i.e. a specific action, you should make a proposal.  Proposals `jump the queue' and should be discussed immediately.  After a decision is made whether to carry out the proposal, the order of speakers should return to that which it was before the proposal was made.

For example:
\begin{itemize}
\item ``Why don't we set up a working group to look into this?''
\item ``I have a friend with a printing press, shall I ask her if we can use it?''
\item ``We should have this camp at XYZ campsite!''
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Direct Points}
If you have a direct response to something somebody has said, you may use the `direct point' hand signal (usually both hands raised), and jump the queue of speakers. Direct points must be used with caution and should be limited to a few sentences at most. They are points of information, and should never express an opinion.

For example:
\begin{itemize}
\item (In response to, ``How many people were at last Venturer Camp?'') ``734.''
\item (In response to, ``Maybe we should use Lockerbrook for this event.'') ``Lockerbrook is fully booked until November.''
\item (In response to, ``I think we should set up a DF Libarary.'') ``We are already in the process of doing exactly that, talk to Esther Price or Joe MacMahon if you want to get involved!''
\end{itemize}
