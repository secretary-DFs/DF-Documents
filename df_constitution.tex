The same person can fill more than one role.

\subsubsection{}

\subsection{Old/New and Secondary Roles}
\label{sec:secondaryroles}
\subsubsection{Old/New}

\label{sec:treasurerrole}
\subsubsection{}
The Shadow Treasurer and Treasurer role are both uniquely different to other Committee roles.

\paragraph{}
The Shadow Treasurer is elected for a term of one year from the floor of Althing. As with other roles, the incumbent Shadow Treasurer may re-stand.
\paragraph{}
The Treasurer is elected for a term of one year by the floor of Althing. Only previous Shadow Treasurers (or the incumbent or previous Treasurers) may stand.

\paragraph{}
The Shadow Treasurer will work with the Treasurer over the next year to learn the skills necessary to carry out the role effectively.
\paragraph{}
Any candidate for Shadow Treasurer must be under 20 years old at Althing, so that after completing a term as Shadow Treasurer, they may still stand for the position of Treasurer.
\paragraph{}
The Treasurer shall produce quarterly financial reports of the DF accounts to be sent to both DF Committee and General Council.
\paragraph{}
\label{sec:treasurerreport}
Before the election of a new Treasurer and Shadow Treasurer, Committee shall submit a report to Althing on their success in the role which shall be included in the minutes. This is to ensure that if that person stands for the role of Treasurer in future years, an informed choice may be made by the floor of Althing.
\subsubsection{No Confidence in the Treasurer}
\label{sec:treasurernoconfidence}
\paragraph{} If the Treasurer position becomes vacant, by a vote of no confidence or otherwise, the Shadow Treasurer shall become the Treasurer and a new Shadow Treasurer shall be co-opted by DF Committee in the usual way (\ref{sec:rolereplacement}).
\paragraph{} If the Shadow Treasurer is unable to fully take on the role of Treasurer, the General Secretary, Chair and Treasurer of the Woodcraft Folk will take on the Treasurer's responsibilities until the Shadow Treasurer has had sufficient training.
\paragraph{} The decision to either hand over or take back power of the accounts will be made by DF Committee.
