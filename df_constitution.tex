\subsection{Committee Roles and Officers}
\subsubsection{}
\label{sec:cttemembership}
Committee shall consist of at most thirteen or fourteen members, with the number varying according to the rules set out in \ref{sec:treasurerrole} and \ref{sec:moreroles}. It shall have the following composition:

\label{sec:election}
\subsubsection{}
Elections for Committee (with the exception of Chair of Regional Council) shall be held at Althing (see section \ref{sec:althing}), and nominations be may made up until the point at which hustings for the positions begins.

\subsubsection{}
The Chair of Regional Council will be elected for a term of one year from and by Regional Council by the method set out in \ref{sec:electionprocedure} at Old/New (see paragraph \ref{sec:rcchair}).

\subsubsection{}
All candidates nominated for positions on Committee must be members of the Woodcraft Folk and DFs, as set out above.

\subsubsection{}
All Committee members, apart from Treasurer and Shadow Treasurer (as set out in \ref{sec:treasurerrole} are elected to serve for a term of two years, from the Old/New immediately before which they were elected to the Old/New held two years later.

\subsubsection{}
\label{sec:electionprocedure}
The election system to be used at Althing shall be as detailed in the Democratic Procedures document.  The voting system shall be AV for single-role elections, and STV for multi-seat elections (e.g. General Council Representatives, Lay Members).

\subsubsection{}
\label{sec:moreroles}
The same person can fill more than one role.

\subsubsection{}
If a position on Committee remains or becomes vacant, Committee may co-opt at their discretion a member of the DF Movement to fill the position.

\subsection{Old/New and Secondary Roles}
\label{sec:secondaryroles}
\subsubsection{Old/New}
\label{sec:oldnew}
\paragraph{} Annually, not more than two months after Althing, DF Committee and Regional Council shall hold a closed meeting called `Old/New'.
\paragraph{} At this meeting DF Committee shall elect, from amongst their number, individuals to hold the following Secondary Roles in addition to the role they were elected to at Althing:
\begin{itemize}
\item Staff Liaison
\item Sustainability Representative
\item Vice Chair of DF Committee
\item Chair of DF Committee
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{} The term of a Secondary Role shall be one year.

\paragraph{} Additionally, two members shall be elected from DF Committee and Regional Council combinded to represent the Movement on the Woodcraft Folk's General Council for one year.

\subsection{Joining and Leaving Committee}
\subsubsection{Vacation of a Role}
A person may no longer serve on Commitee if:
\begin{enumerate}[\hspace{0.5cm}(a)]
\item they cease to be a member of the organisation; or
\item they stand down by notice to the DF Movement; or
\item they lose a vote of no confidence as set out in \ref{sec:noconfidence}
\end{enumerate}
\subsubsection{Vote of No Confidence}
\label{sec:noconfidence}
\paragraph{} Any DF may call a vote of no confidence on a member of Committee; this vote will be taken by Committee (excluding the member in question) and will require an 2/3rds majority vote to pass.
\paragraph{} A vote may be helt at any time as long as the Committee member in question was given at least 10 days' notice of the vote, and is offered to present their case to Committee either in person or in writing before the vote. Every member of Committee must be involved in the discussion and the vote.
\paragraph{} In the case of physical or mental incapacity, lack of attendance, or lack of report production to Committee meetings twice in a row, a vote of no confidence shall take place automatically.
\subsubsection{Replacement of a Role}
\label{sec:rolereplacement}
\paragraph{} If any vacancies arise on Committee, Committee may co-opt any member of the Movement to fill the vacancy. This will require a 2/3rds majority decision to pass.
\paragraph{} If a person holding a 2-year role, with the exception of the Campaigns Rep and either Lay Member, stands down mid-term at an Althing, an election shall be held in the usual way for the role, and the role will be held by the winner of the election for a further 2 years.
\paragraph{} Since campaigns are elected for 2 years at a time, if a new Campaigns Representative is elected mid-term, they will only serve up until the end of the campaign underway when they were elected, i.e. for 1 year.
\paragraph{} This does not apply to Lay Members, as there should always be one Lay Member elected at each Althing. Therefore if a Lay Member stands down mid-term, the person elected to replace them will only serve until the end of the term of the person they are replacing, i.e. for 1 year.

\subsection{Role of the Treasurer}
\label{sec:treasurerrole}
\subsubsection{}
The Shadow Treasurer and Treasurer role are both uniquely different to other Committee roles. It has been recognised that the role of Shadow Treasurer and Treasurer are particularly challenging and important to the movement. This system set out below has therefore been adopted and supersedes the provisions set out above.
\paragraph{}
The Shadow Treasurer is elected for a term of one year from the floor of Althing. As with other roles, the incumbent Shadow Treasurer may re-stand.
\paragraph{}
The Treasurer is elected for a term of one year by the floor of Althing. Only previous Shadow Treasurers (or the incumbent or previous Treasurers) may stand.
\paragraph{}
This will mean that any Treasurer elected at an Althing will have already been a Shadow Treasurer at some point.
\paragraph{}
The Shadow Treasurer will work with the Treasurer over the next year to learn the skills necessary to carry out the role effectively.
\paragraph{}
Any candidate for Shadow Treasurer must be under 20 years old at Althing, so that after completing a term as Shadow Treasurer, they may still stand for the position of Treasurer.
\paragraph{}
The Treasurer shall produce quarterly financial reports of the DF accounts to be sent to both DF Committee and General Council.
\paragraph{}
\label{sec:treasurerreport}
Before the election of a new Treasurer and Shadow Treasurer, Committee shall submit a report to Althing on their success in the role which shall be included in the minutes. This is to ensure that if that person stands for the role of Treasurer in future years, an informed choice may be made by the floor of Althing.
\subsubsection{No Confidence in the Treasurer}
\label{sec:treasurernoconfidence}
\paragraph{} If the Treasurer position becomes vacant, by a vote of no confidence or otherwise, the Shadow Treasurer shall become the Treasurer and a new Shadow Treasurer shall be co-opted by DF Committee in the usual way (\ref{sec:rolereplacement}).
\paragraph{} If the Shadow Treasurer is unable to fully take on the role of Treasurer, the General Secretary, Chair and Treasurer of the Woodcraft Folk will take on the Treasurer's responsibilities until the Shadow Treasurer has had sufficient training.
\paragraph{} The decision to either hand over or take back power of the accounts will be made by DF Committee.
