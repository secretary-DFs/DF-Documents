  * Joe (Accessibility)
    * Recently we have been working on setting up a system for accessibility reps to follow for events. this includes:
      * Writing a site assessments, in full detail. Researching distances, travel times and prices to get to the site. This should help events reps and other accessibility reps in the future to decide which site to go to.
    * Writing up documents with accessibility info for people to see before they book, which don't have the address or specific info in them. Just to give people and idea of what it's like on site
    * Writing up site reviews after the event takes place detailing all the problems faced and ways of fixing them.
    * We also made a handover pack for future accessibility reps, and a role summary that could possibly go on the website.
    * We have been helping with Spring Awakening (SA) preparation, mainly getting the welcome pack ready.
    * Generally things are going well and feeling on top of responsibilities :)

    * I spent a lot of time, energy and stress on trying to sort out the Erasmus grant refunding situation. After lot of back and forth between us and central Woodcraft, we split the cost 50/50 with them. This is not ideal, and I disagree with Kinderfreunde not paying any money but I am not willing to put the amount of effort in that would be required to possibly change their mind. I’ve been working very closely with Alexi, doing fairer fair, incomings and outgoings and chasing people up fo old event payments over the last two years. Robin, Alexi and I reviewed events budgets very roughly. I edited the money policy to add some stuff with what happened with Erasmus in mind. I also helped find the venue for welsh thing.
    * In the next quarter I aim to get the bank account sorted, chase up worker’s beer from 2017, make a centralised “naughty list” to better keep track of who owes us money, chase more people up, and begin updating the treasurer’s guide to treasuring with Alexi. I have a positive outlook on the next quarter, as I no longer have a full time job and long commute! (whoop whoop)
  * Brynn (Safeguarding & GC)
    * **SG** - I have had several cases all come up at the same time that I have been dealing with but have been very slow on. So I would like to find a better system for dealing with this because right now it isn’t ok. I have talked several of these over with Deb’s now so that should hopefully help.
    * **GC** - I have missed one meeting so as that I could come to the last thing but made it to the most recent meeting in February. We submitted motions to AG one of which was to raise membership fees but we have decided to raise the wage one made on mode average wage and the unwaged to remain at £12 a year to respect the DFs in the moment and that. This may or may not pass at AG this year. We have also decided to officially back the climate strikes that are happening in the UK which I think people in DF should now make an effort to promote as we can now officially back them.
  * Beth (Laymember)
    *
  * Alfie, Eliot, Hazel, Chris need to do
    *
  * **ADD OTHER PEOPLES**
1. Venturer Camp
  * We have all the centers decided
    * There's no rainbow center so centers should try and incorporate it into other centre programmes
  * Precamp is at the same time as AG
    * May speed up

1. Policy Policy & Food policy
  * Joel-put in place last year, the food policy was kind of a mess, lots of contention. Joel rewrote the entire policy around Althing, change. most important thing is that anyone can eat and everything else is up to KPs discression.

      * Sustainability, Removed a bit about food miles
      * Ethical Eating
      * Local produce, difficult to use, not as much emphasis
      * Reducing cost
    * Lara - Reducing cost doesn't need to be in a policy as this informs ethics rather than stratergy
    * Sarah - Maybe just have a sentance about keeping costs down but then refer to seperate guide to KP or some such document.
    * Noah - Change to say that cost is
    * Action Joel- Discount for the coop, talk to chris about Guide to kp
    * Joel Policy Policy - Anyone can put forward a policy, discuss at a Thing may not be representative of
    * Also send to the Secretary rather than Chair
    * How to write a policy, policies should be discussed multiple times, when writting Policy just doi it
    * Lara - Add Vctte the opption to write policies, minimum number to approve a policy or at least someone not on Committee

1. Events Budget Review
    * Upped Food budget
      * £3 too low, £4 too high, £3.25 seems reasonable
    * Upped Accommodation
      * £3.50 pp/n
    * Surplus is little but there is still profit, just already allocated for stuff
    * Programme
      * £2 too £1.15
    * It's very difficult to raise prices, but it is a necessary evil as the price of running events.
    * last time it was raised was 2015 and 2013 before that
    * Could we ask other DFs to subsidies other DF who can't
      * There are possible ways of doing this
    * showing the exact ways that the budget has changed
      * It's difficult for fundraising to get money for widen participation as we aren't a underpriviliged group
    * It can be very difficut to get people to pay more money
    * Using a system for getting money similar to Fairer fare or just adding on to the fairer fundraising
      * adding to fairer fare doesn't help people who live Local
    * emailing parents to ask for money for the solidarity fund.
    * Fairer Fare doesn't get used much, could we split it to reduce price for someone
    * **Action: Robin to add this stuff to the Events form**
    * Could we have card reader for people on events to make it easier
      * **Action Lara and Alexi to find out about that**
        * Only usable in sites with data
        * £30 for one but has a charge of 1%
    * Site Prices
      * WW has a flat cost for site
      * SA has both a flat cost and per person per night site cost
      * DF Camp has per person night site cost
    * Taking money from fairer?
      * taking £1 from £5
        * £2 is a lot and could cause bug issues for people
      * £1 should be a good limit
      * We should advertise Fairer Fare more
        * **Action: Lara, make thing for info pack**
      *
